							<h2>Who</h2>
							<h3><a href="https://www.instagram.com/im.unlearning/?hl=en"><i>@im.unlearning</i></a> is a personal</h3>
							<p>multimedia journal I started in qurantine May 21, 2020 to express myself, connect with creating and find my voice in my community. It also
							serves as a way to visually measure and track my creative progress and initatives. I experiment with animation, reels, video, illustrations, comics and poetry.
							<u>All of my video/ film work lives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbdrWcelHwrtK8JTF7zV03A">here!</a></u></p>
							<hr />
							<h2>What</h2>
							<p>Centered around my own experiences with Covid, living in NYC in my 20's, mental health, being biracial, etc.
							it has evolved to a platform for me to experiment with different digital mediums (animation, illustration, comic, poems) and create hope for others.
							It allows me to stay consistent with daily design thinking and meditating. I aspire to create a community dedicated to helping and sharing resources,
							experiences and discussing our collective feelings.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>Why</h2>
							<p>Covid shined a light on the cracks we have as individuals and in our society that we try to hide. All the ways we've convinced ourselves through capitalism
								that we're better off doing it alone, chasing that bag and valueing material success over communal and personal. It made me realize the bigger
								picture I was meant for, rather than getting distracted by get rich- quick schemes, social media fame and what everyone else is doing. I was meant
								to storytell and help others.
								<br />
								<br />
								I wasn't satisfied with monotony and going through the motions anymore. Almost everyone everywhere is unhappy and unfulfilled living
								 to work, so I decided if that was inevtiable then I'd at least try to 1) change things, 2) give back/ leave it better, and 3) chase my dreams.
								 This journal is my hope for better for myself and others.</p>

								<p>From my first post in May 2020 to February 2022 (present day) the change and influences of my work have
								changed dramatically. Before this project, I was afraid to post on social media about myself and despite living in nyc, had major
							 	anxiety being perceived by others. Sharing my personal experiences and talking about myself on here, has challenged my
						 		idea of personal success as well as influencing and my relationship with social media.
								<br />
								<br />
								Although there is a fine line between your personal identity, that cannot be defined even physically, and your online -self, it ultimately has empowered me to be
								more self confident in who I am and seek change not for fame or money but for myself and the betterment of others.
								Looking forward, I plan to create and trust myself more rather than try to predict the wave of trends and dive deeper
							into sharing stories in these mediums.</p>
