							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>Through word of mouth, I re- designed and updated a friend's teacher,<a href="http://www.norawoolley.com/"><i> Nora Woolley's,</i></a> portfolio site on WordPress.
							This project lasted from <i>Oct. 2021 to Dec. 2021</i> and was my first time freelancing with a client before. I met with
							Nora on a number of consultations to understand what she wanted to keep and throw away, since we working off an already
							existing outdated WordPress site she had from 2012.</p>
							<br />

							<h2>Deliverables</h2>
							<p>The photos above are comparisons between before (left), after (right), and the T- chart I made to map out simplifying navigation and adding the elements she wanted.
							And where we originally had 5 tabs, we were able to get her down to two. My priortities were: interactive elements, reduce static text, 100% responsive, and minimalist feel.
							<br />
							<br />
							<u>Skills:</u> WordPress, Web Design, Consulting, Layout design, Freelance</p>
							<br />
							<h2>Takeaways</h2>
							<p>Biggest takaways were that it was a successful project and I loved getting to work one-on-one with people. I've always wanted to be my own boss
							but freelancing as an industry is extremely difficult to make a living off of. You must be very careful with everything from time management,
							clients to billing. Lastly, WordPress itself is outdated and I would not use again with a client. I suggested we make the switch to Squarespace or Wix
							but since the primary use of her site was for documenting her past work, it made sense not to pay more money for the service.</p>

							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>My interest in Seeking Each Other, or EO for short, was to experiment with branding, social media and communications. I was thinking
							about re- humanizing our interactions with each other and building a digital and IRL community actively unified in
							sharing experiences, guidance and information with one another. Although living online it would priortize content
							that supports the body and healthy media diets (or internet usage).
							<br />
							<br />
							In a hypercapitalistic society, the general quality of livelihood, solely relys on the individual's conscious. This
							disporportionality affects commununities in the lower and middler- lower class as there's inequal access to resources
							 and said products, to improve their quality of life. If we funded and emphasized our communal and neighborly
						 	relationships, the burden would be much less manageable.

							<u>Skills:</u> Branding, UX/ UI, Product/ Web/ Social Media Design, Communications</p>

							<h2 id="content">Takeaways</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/figma.png" alt="" /></span></p> Since EO's value or product isn't actually a product, I knew I had to emphasize
							straight- forward and minimalist design communication. I settled with informative and geometric as the best design intention. I learned a lot through this
							project and how hard it is to start anything from scratch. It was great practice for when I plan to start my own business and apply some of the lessons
							I learned into <a href="archives.html">ATHT</a>. The full Figma documentation and design documents can be found here: <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Ww2aBQgp3EGohemqBrhEBZ/SEO-LOGO?node-id=35%3A26">here!</a></p>
