							<h2>Who</h2>
							<p>An aspiring self- taught producer passionate about showing rather than telling through different digital mediums. After taking a mandatory film course at NYU,
							I was instantly captured by filmmaking. It made me feel seen and heard in a way that I've never felt before. The entirety of my work lives
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbdrWcelHwrtK8JTF7zV03A"><i>here !</i></a>
							<br />
							<br />
							One of the biggest influencers of my passion was Sean Baker, director of <i>The Florida Project and Tangerine.</i> I attended a
							director's panel talk and he explained his past work, come up and his organic style of rogue filming. I was astonished. My next
							conduit would be Hayayo Miyazaki and specifically the unpredictable and magical plots and character -depth he reveals like input
							<i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> and <i>Princess Mononoke</i>. Miyazaki inspired me to want to tell unseen stories of society and the importance of doing so.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>With What?</h2>
							<p>With my Iphone 10, a cheap lav mic, and a fold-up tripod off amazon, I set to work. Filming became my therapy
							during the pandemic and it comforted me in a way that the digital stimulation of apps, media, and the internet couldn't.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>And Why?</h2>
							<p>Filmmaking is my calling. It's my medium. It's my purpose. I'm meant to experiment and find the best ways we
							can communicate and reach audiences to help them. To portray the things media doesn't want to show you, to portray
							the things we ourselves are ashamed to see. I don't believe film is meant as an escape but a lense we can use to better see reality through.</p>

								<h1>The World We Can and Should Be (Post- Pandemic)</h1>

									<h2>What is it?</h2>
									<p><i>The World We Can and Should Be,</i> was my self- produced senior thesis, asking people on the street 'in a post- pandemic world',
									the possible solutions to our tomorrow. How can we show- up better for ourselves and others. What has Covid taught us?
									What hasn't it taught us? I wanted it to live solely as an introduction and exemplary work piece on my Youtube and website of
									how flexible and crafty I can be.</p>

									<h2>After- Thoughts</h1>
									<p>Using all the techniques I self- learned and practiced in school, I really wanted to challenge myself
									and try 2D animation, motion graphics and also a documentary- style of interviewing people in public. With the
									help of my two roommates as moderators, I filmed, edited and documented within four months from 01/2021 to 05/2021.
									<br />
									<br />
									Inspired by <i>Billy On the Street</i>, <i>Sidetalknyc,</i> and <i>whatisnewyork</i>, I've always
									been on the shyer side. In order to lean into my passion and truly embrace it and myself I wanted
									a project that would force me to put myself out there. The response was so overwhelming. We filmed not long after lockdown
									ended and people responded with such love, care and intelligence. It showed me I had nothing to be afraid of.</p>

									<h2>What is it?</h2>
									<p><i>21st Century Mind</i> is an exploration of technology and humanity in our everyday lives and how it shapes
										how we see each other. Originally made for a class final, I was moved to tell my own personal experiences.</p>

									<h2>After- Thoughts</h1>
									<p>Using mostly archived footage, I was inspired to visualize a sense of "old ways" we've come from and to
										turn a critical eye towards what "progress" has done for us. Striking the chords of nostalgia, yearning, the unknown and courage.
									<br />
									<br />
									I was heavily influenced by the state of the world during the making. I stayed in my NYC apartment for the entirety
									of lockdown while my roomamtes left for their hometowns. I was finishing zoom school and remote working, all while physically never
									leaving my apartment. I become swallowed by the thought that our digital selves hold more meaning and identity than our
									real physical selves do. This both frightened and saddened me.</p>

									<h2>What is it?</h2>
									<p><i>When I Close My Eyes,</i> explores how we cope with the chaos and noise of the world, while keeping our sanity and humanity.
									It touches on themes of mental health of insomniac's, coping mechanisms, and the internal dialogue that runs through our heads.
									It was made as a final for an animation course at NYU.</p>
