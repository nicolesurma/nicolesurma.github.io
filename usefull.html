							<h2>Who</h2>
							<p><i>Use Full</i> is a mobile app, who's mission is to increase visibility and accessibility to shared real life communal spaces for healing, aid and community building events, such as: food pantries, fridges and skills as a resource for independent community run aid.
							Whether you're in need of help or giving it, <i>Use Full</i> seeks to expedite your process of finding it, free of policing from racist + political Algorithms.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>What</h2>
							<p>Create and design a working pototype for a mobile or web app that will solve a current societal problem. Conduct market research/ analysis, use testing,
							and lo-fi and hi- fidelity wireframes outlining the interface and well- thought out user interactions and experiences.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>Problem- Solution</h2>
							<p>We've witnessed an increase in reliance on our digital platforms as communal and resource driven spaces through Instagram, Tik Tok, Twitter, etc. despite having racist AI and clear political incentives with their censorship.
							At it's best, <i>Use Full</i> will serve as a replacement for Twitter, IG, and Tik Tok's trickle down method of information to one another. And serve as a way for validating information and people from misinformation.</p>

							<h2>Features</h2>
							<br />

								<h3><u>Optimized Search Settings</u></h3>
									<p>It features an <b>"Urgent/ Immediate"</b> filter preference for individuals in dire situations. This will update their feed and map to prioritize the posts and opportunities marked this as well. Categories are defined by the service types you're looking for: <u>Housing, Supplies, Food, Support and Workshop</u>. By dividing care and aid into 5 essential categories, we want to streamline the opportunities and services we can provide and connect each other to. Clicking the city name at the top, will quick-change the location services. While the hamburger bar in the top right is to quick-access the "Profile" section, where they can see their UpVote score and check notifications.</p>
								<h3><u>UpVotes System</u></h3>
									<p>In profile settings, an <b>UpVote number</b> is featured underneath your profile picture. UpVotes are earned by creating posts that are verified by Use Full's team and the amount of interactivity it gets through: other's uploading verified media, comments, hearts, views and pinning announcements in your post. Titles can be earned based on UpVotes such as <u>"Super Organizer" or "Novice Planner"</u> to encourage user engagement with their own posts. I added this to establish legitimacy and trust between users and developers, as well as create a hierarchy of levels the user can build to and gain to feel even more involved within their community.</p>
								<h3><u>Community</u></h3>
									<p>To encourage communal support and unification, I've added a <b>"Commmunities"</b> section for user leadership and independence. This function is to promote more irl events and engagement for users interested in gaining UpVotes and creating a network of contributors and participants. Ideally this feature will be utilized for planning and coordinating events that require more team work and organizing. The section at the top with the Star is a fixed animation that will run on loop throughout the day, as the Star goes about its comfy and cozy apartment. This feature is also on the Star/ Feed page, found through the star icon in the bottom navigation, which shows collapsible, expandible posts featured on the Home page.</p>

							<h2>How It's Made</h2>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/figma.png" alt="" /></span><p>I utilized the programs Figma and Photoshop to create it.
							I wanted an inclusive and accessible feel for all age demographics so I chose organic and earthy tones, over the usual hues of blues and greys we see over-used
							in modern app development. The full Figma document can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Oi3NW55czj39IEPLpKU9tG/Style-Guide-Use-Full?node-id=0%3A1">here!</a></p>

							<p>The project lasted from <i>Aug. 2020 to Dec. 2020</i>. After doing a competitive market resarch and analysis, my inital inspiration was a friendlier, more philanthropist approach to <a href="https://citizen.com/">Citizens App.</a>
							While the app functionality, is a mix of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meet up</a> and <a href="https://nextdoor.com/">Next Door</a> inspired. I believe this added to its success
						during user testing and a/b testing on zoom, as most people intuitively understood it's purpose and expressed a genuine value to the app.</p>
